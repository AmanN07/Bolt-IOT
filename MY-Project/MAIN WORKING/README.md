This directory in the actual code base for the project. 

To run the code you will be needing a BOLT Wifi Module, breadboard, LM35 sensor, 10k ohm resistors and few connecting wires.

Just run the On_or_Off.py file to execute the code. It will implement the anomaly detection algorithm on sudden drop in temperature value for which location you are using the IOT device.
